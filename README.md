# 🎄 Merry Christmas  
## from the Corcoran Branch Presidency

> *“For it is good to be children sometimes, and never better than at Christmas,  
when its mighty Founder was a child Himself.”*  
**— Charles Dickens**

> *“Christmas is the season for kindling the fire of hospitality.”*  
**— Washington Irving**

> *“Christmas is a time to remember that we are all children of a Father in Heaven  
who gave His Only Begotten Son that all would be redeemed from death and who has  
offered the blessings of salvation and exaltation to all mankind on the same conditions.”*  
**— Dallin H. Oaks**

> *“Let us never forget that we are disciples and followers of Jesus Christ,  
the living Son of the living God. To truly honor His coming into the world,  
we must do as He did and reach out in compassion and mercy to our fellowmen.  
This we can do daily, by word and deed. Let this become our Christmas tradition,  
no matter where we are — to be a little kinder, more forgiving, less judging,  
more grateful and more generous in sharing our abundance with those in need.”*  
**— Dieter F. Uchtdorf**

## 📖 Scripture Reading  
### Luke 2:4–20

> 4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea,  
> unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; because he was of the house  
> and lineage of David:  
>  
> 5 To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.  
>  
> 6 And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished  
> that she should be delivered.  
>  
> 7 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes,  
> and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.  
>  
> 8 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field,  
> keeping watch over their flock by night.  
>  
> 9 And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord  
> shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.  
>  
> 10 And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings  
> of great joy, which shall be to all people.  
>  
> 11 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.  
>  
> 12 And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes,  
> lying in a manger.  
>  
> 13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,  
>  
> 14 Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.  
>  
> 15 And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven,  
> the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem,  
> and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.  
>  
> 16 And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.  
>  
> 17 And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying  
> which was told them concerning this child.  
>  
> 18 And all they that heard it wondered at those things  
> which were told them by the shepherds.  
>  
> 19 But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.  
>  
> 20 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God  
> for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.
