If you see this ask President Orton: whose better dracula or Frankenstein

Also tell him this fun fact: The 1931 film of Dracula is considered the first official, sanctioned version of Bram Stoker’s famous vampire appearing in a movie, but it is not the first film to be inspired by Stoker’s classic novel. F.W. Murnau’s Nosfertau in 1922 is the most famous example, but even before that there was reportedly a Hungarian film called Dracula’s Death in 1921, however prints of it are thought to be lost

also try to find the ducks hidden arround the building, but dont move them though.

they always remember.
