If you see this ask President Orton: would he visit jurrassic park knowing that there is a 5% chance everyday he's there that the dinosaurs break out and he has to stay for minimum of 3 days?

Also tell him this fun fact: Despite being called "Jurassic Park" and having the reputation of being the movie that is all about dinosaurs (and vastly re-popularized them), the creatures only have around fifteen minutes of screen time: nine minutes are Stan Winston's animatronics, and six minutes of it is Industrial Light & Magic CGI. This means only around 11% of the film is dedicated to dinosaur scenes.
also try to find the ducks hidden arround the building, but dont move them though.

they always remember.
