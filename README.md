November 1 Branch Pinewood Derby

If you see this ask President Orton: what is his favorite scary movie?

also tell him this fun fact: The Mummy writer John Lloyd Balderston was a foreign correspondent for New York World, and he wrote extensively about the opening of Tutankhamun’s tomb in 1922. Originally, Universal’s film was going to follow a 300-year-old magician living in San Francisco, but when Balderston joined the project, he moved the story to Egypt, renamed the main character Imhotep, and focused in on the Scroll of Thoth..

also try to find the ducks hidden arround the building, but dont move them though.

the always remember.
